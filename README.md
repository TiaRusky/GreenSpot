# GreenSpot
Spot accumulations of waste around the world.

# Base Idea
An Android application, built with **JetpackCompose**, used to report possible accumultions of waste in your city. The application is designed to be used by 2 types of users: **spotters**, those who report an accumulation, and **cleaners**, those who have the possibility of eliminating an accumulation. Each spotter, when he identifies an accumulation, can **report** it on the application, providing a photo, the position, obtained through geolocation and, if necessary, a brief description. Each report has a ranking, which specifies the number of users who have identified this accumulation. Cleaners, by accessing the application, have a page available to analyze reports, based on ranking and position. Once the cleaner cleans an area, the area must be reported as clean, and then removed from active reports. The spotter that have reported a spot that has benn clened up will receive token.
